----Hosting a static website on AWS----
-------------------------------------------------------------
The index.html file provided here is the file I created within the S3 bucket.

In order to successfully host this static website, we need to implement specific modifications.

Upon completion of the necessary modifications, you will receive the object URL, which will be shared with you.

By clicking on the object URL, you will be able to view the hosted static website.

Based on the aforementioned information, we can confidently assert that we have effectively hosted a static webpage using the AWS platform using S3 bucket.
